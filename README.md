## üìù Overview

Autopog is a browser-based web application that simulates a lively, fake Twitch chat and can listen to your mic for a more immersive experience. The result mimics the chat plugin from Streamlabs OBS and can be injected directly into your stream.

## üôè Credits 

This project builds on existing open source projects and would not have been made possible without their prior efforts:

- [AsaeoluElijah/say-it](https://github.com/AsaoluElijah/say-it) (MIT) for its speech-to-text implementation.
- [cwilso/volume-meter](https://github.com/cwilso/volume-meter) (MIT) for its audio input meter implementation.
